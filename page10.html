Imagine wasting all your time and energy feeling excited about getting to nowhere?&nbsp;It's like climbing up a ladder just to find out that you're on the wrong wall ctto. If it was not for that dog, who knows where that road leads to?<br><br>So,<br><br>Travelling tip #1 Do not use&nbsp;Google Maps on mountains. It only tracks roads. I suggest you guys go to the information center and ask for a tour guide.<br><br>Bottomline is,<br><br>Are you lost?

I just saw it on facebook. They are very accommodating and the place had a great view. The restroom is clean. The rooms available range from 250-500 php. They give free tea and coffee, too. If I will rate the place I will give it a 5 out of 5.<br><br>Warning though: Nasa baba po ito ng bundok. Three times Pasig Science 6th floor stairs friends with no handrails and very very steep.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Remember the jeepney that goes to Batad from Banaue at 2:00 p.m. It fetches people from Batad at 9:00 a.m.<br><br>I went back to my inn, took a shower and prepared my things.<br><br>Yes,<br><br>Aakyat ako ulit guys dun sa bundok at dadaan dun sa makitid na daan patungo sa kabihasnan :(<br><br>It was already 8:45 a.m. if I miss the jeepney, I will ride the one-way tricycle again.<br><br>Dead tired. I stopped around 5-6 times during the climb up the mountain and I stopped 3-5 times as I was walking through my way back to where I was dropped off yesterday.<br><br>I lost hope. I knew I was not going to make it in time. So I rested.<br><br>While I was resting I saw some students passing right at me and I thought, wow these children do this everyday just to get to school and I was there for just a day? Who am I to complain?<br><br>One girl stopped right in front at me and smiled,<br><br>I got back up and kept on walking. I stopped and walked, stopped, walked. I felt like it was the longest walk of my life. It was easier going down but going up? I was on the verge of giving up.<br><br>Until,<br><br>Kuya: "Ma'am Banaue po?"<br><br>E: "Opo"<br><br>Kuya: "May tricycle po kayo?"<br><br>E: "Wala po, nandon pa po ba yung jeep?"<br><br>Kuya: "Ako po yung driver" :(<br><br>Goosebumps.&nbsp;<br><br>Wait, di pa tapos..<br><br>Kuya: "May nakakita po kase sainyo na mga estudyante di na daw po kayo makalakad kaya po sinundo ko na po kayo dito."<br><br>Goosebumps ulit.<br><br>And, I was crying behind him. Thank You Lord, I knew this was You. Thank you rin kuya. Thank you dun sa students. This was the third time someone saved me from the pain and struggle that I was going through. These people do not even know who I am but their hearts are just the purest and words will never suffice of how great they are.<br><br>When I rode the jeepney, everyone followed as if they waited for me, and wala akong masabi kundi thank you nalang.<br><br>I was looking for some of the boys na nakita ko din and I could not find them.<br><br>I went out and saw them on top of the jeep!<br><br>E: "Pwede ako dyan?"<br><br>Kuya: "Pwede po"<br><br>Ayun, I witnessed the whole beauty of Batad and its people in just a small amount of time that I stayed there. I overheard them talking about how lucky they were that there was a jeepney available. So I asked,<br><br>E: "Paano kung walang jeep?"<br><br>Kuya: "Naglalakad po kami"<br><br>Shookt.&nbsp;<br><br>E: "Gaano katagal lakad niyo?"<br><br>Kuya: "3 hours"<br><br>I was not able to utter another word after that. When we got to their school he said,<br><br>Kuya: "Ate ayan po yung paaralan namin"<br><br>I never thought that there could be an entirely different world from mine. I complain about too many things. Rant about the silliest things and long for more than what I have. When others, simply desire to have a jeepney ride.<br><br>Complaining about being stuck in traffic for 3 hours? Compared to walking to school for 3 hours? Complaining about carrying bags with clothes in it when children carry hollow-blocks for a living. Complaining about slow internet when others barely have mobile signal to communicate with their loved ones.<br><br>All of these things. Thought me how to be grateful. To stop being a prejudice. To be contented and to appreciate more. Through this journey, I fell more deeply in love with the Lord through every smiling face, through the care and love of the Ifugao natives, through His creation and more importantly, His presence.<br><br>I may have gone through a lot of trials but one thing is for sure, I was never alone.<br><br>-End-</p>
