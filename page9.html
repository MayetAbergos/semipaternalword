He only wants the best and His plans are far greater than ours.<br><br>I want to share how God answers when we communicate with Him, through His Word, the Bible; He answers through parables that only you, can understand. He uses people as well, to lead you where you should go, what you should and exactly what you need to hear when you need it. It is more like a communication with your friend. We pray to speak with God, he answers back through His Word through what we call "Devotion" You can ask me more about it, if you want to.<br><br>I prayed about the job offered and here's what God said,</p>

We went to the recruitment site at Eton Cyberpod in front of Robinson's Galleria, Ortigas. Believe me, I had no idea what was going to happen, I was terrified. I recently graduated from high school, have no job experience, had never been to real job interviews or whatsoever. All I know was how to make a resume, and oh, sit erect when being interviewed. But, God said yes, so I claimed that everything will run smoothly and fine. Why was I worrying in the first? God's got this.<br><br>To cut the long story short we went through a lot of procedures, and praise God, got hired. Contract signing was around 12 midnight April 17, 2018, yes, it took as one whole day, but it was all worth it.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">We had exactly, 40 days of training. Work never felt like "work" though, because the atmosphere was light and it felt more like we were attending special classes for the summer and we were there to learn how to engage with people we never met, hear voices we have to listen to, and be of help to them as if they were not on the other side of the earth. It was nice.<br><br>As training went by, I got to know them and things got serious. Maintaining the necessary metrics, like grades in school is one thing but it is another thing to carry a lot of weight of the world to work and act like everything is going well. As I spoke to each person in that class, I can't help but thank God for what He has done and His love. People need to be reminded of how much God loves them because the world will make you forget. It is going to distract you, hurt you, break you, and lose your sight of His purpose for your life. We will constantly illuminate pain, struggle, low-esteem, shame and fear.</p>

During the training, in God's name I shared the wonders of having that personal relationship with God. The feeling of being held up high when everything seems to be falling apart. His Word, His gospel, His comfort is what stirs people to live every day and be strong in the midst of dark seasons.<br><br>I admire a lot of people at work. They strive and work at their best to put plate on the table. Everyone I met, taught me a lesson that I will carry for life. In the same way that I hope that I was able to remind them that it is not about religion, it not about how good we are, is about how good He is and what He demonstrated on that cross to make us whole. That every time you see that cross, I pray that you will be reminded that you are, valued, you have a purpose and you are, loved.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Beyond the names and accounts I opened, I hope that I became of good assistance to the people I answered the call and a good colleague. Working at a call center company is not easy, you work at night, sleep in the morning. More time for work, have less time for yourself, family and friends. Stress and traffic is there. You will get burned out. Plus, you need a lot of patience, respect, open-mindedness, love, care, empathy, understanding, genuineness, and peace in your heart.<br><br>I will never forget that line that Ms. Zuniga (my former teacher in English in high school) said during our class, "Everyone is fighting battles you do not know about, so always be kind" and, indeed it is true. I applied here in my job and let it manifest.</p>

It made me realize that life could be tough without God. I became more understanding and open to listening to others. I was one of the youngest employees and just imagine having a lot of ates and kuyas surrounding you. It could change you, big time.</p>

During my last day, I made the most out of it and gave out letters to each person I knew to show gratitude and appreciation. It was heartbreaking saying goodbye but I had to.</p>
