But does she stop running?<br><br>Did she back-out? No. Because she knows that whatever happens her identity is in Christ, and she isn't of this world. She is strong, dignified and loved. Valuable, precious and worthy. Added to that she knows she has Someone greater than herself fighting for and with her.<br><br>-End-</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">June 2018, I witnessed kung gaano kahirap yung dinanas ni Irish. Watching someone you love so dear go through all the pain; that's something even I can't imagine, it is too unbearable, but looking at Irish, she withstood it all. She continued to inspire not just herself but many. She does the most amazing plates with her amazing hands and even managed to draw an amazing smile on her face despite everything.<br><br>Kahit pagod na pagod na siya she does her best for the people she loves. I will never forget that experience when I was holding her father's hand, praying, when he got a seizure attack, I could not explain the feeling, everything just fainted away, I was not a daughter not anywhere near to being a relative but I felt the emotions in the whole room. That is why I salute you, Irish so much.<br><br>But even in that situation I was believing that he was going to fight back, and he ---- did. He fought long enough, and it was time for him to rest. As he grabbed my hand, I knew he wanted to tell Irish how much he loves her even one last time, to see her graduate as an architect, to see her young lady turn into a fine woman.<br><br>Now, Irish has two fathers in heaven looking out and protecting her. Nothing can compare a father's love for his daughter, but thank you, Irish, thank you for being strong for us, the people who are here for you. Your father is so proud of you, make him even more proud by living your life for him, living the life he wanted for you.<br><br>-End-</p>

Sobrang laki ng sprout mo, natatandaan ko nung birthday ko you said "Sabi ko di ko kaya yang ginagawa niyo but look at me now" and the devil is doing the best that he can do bring you down; all his might kase sobrang light yung nasshine mo he can't afford you winning more souls for Christ kaya no no no girl! Di tayo papaantig. We are eagles soaring high.<br><br>Pero now, I guess, kailangan mo rin magpahinga. Please take your time, unwind and regenerate all the strength you've lost. Sobrang bilib ako sayo talaga as in like grabe for being so strong sunod sunod yung bugbog ng 2018 and even in the beginning of this year, I pray that soon your resurrection will come. Even Jesus rests, He sleeps in the middle of the storm, and you can too! Thank you Irish for being one of those people na nakaimpact sa life ko. I am beyond blessed na ginawa tayong magkaibigan Ni God.<br><br>I am sorry and apologize if nagkulang ako in any way. I'm sorry din if ever you guys thought na lumayo ako, hehe I had battles din di ko nagawang magsabi because I was always the positive one, di ko gustong maging burden, but that event in my life had a purpose din.<br><br>Grade 10 nung naging kaklase kita and woooooooo I am so glad I met you sunshine! For real, I say this quite a thousand times na pero totoo kase epitome of psalm 139:14 fearfully and wonderfully made! Talent, passion, determination everything! You are too pretty to be staying down! You are meant to be extraordinary as you already are. Please do not let the cruel world shut you down, nandito kami for you. Do not let the circumstances cloud your purpose sa world na 'to. Your dreams, you are going to achieve them!</p>
