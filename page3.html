                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Before you read, open your eyes to reality, at the same time, feel the gravity of His unchanging grace, and keep in mind that hate has no place in our hearts whatsoever.<br><br>Let me share how God filled me with His Love that it caused me to breakthrough from one of the darkest days of my entire life.<br><br>I am writing this with the hopes of shedding light especially those who are suffering from affliction. This does not in any way intend to provoke anger and sympathy but rather come into a realization that we can still catch our last breath even if drowning already became a choice. I don't know your story, you may be going through tough times right now, but Jesus can and will definitely grab that hand and pull you up.<br><br>Just like how He did it to me...<br><br>I was in senior high school, grade 12, an aspiring student praying of graduating with flying colors. I was diligent, attentive, and active in class. Outside of my school life, I was known for being a follower of Jesus. 2 grace-filled years had passed since the day I accepted Him into my life but, what happens when the world tries to pull you down? Will you let it?<br><br>To you who is reading this, I want you to know that having Jesus does not mean that life will be perfect nor will it excuse us from all the trials and tribulations in this world. But, He did say in His Word in Deuteronomy 31:6,<br><br>"Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake."<br><br>This is true. I testify in this life event.<br><br>October 23, 2017...<br><br>I was harassed in my own home.<br><br>That morning, as I was sleeping... I was awakened by the most horrifying incident in my life. As I opened my eyes, everything seemed blurry at first, but when my sight cleared up, I saw what can never be erased in my memory.<br><br>Our house helper's son, was touching, squeezing, and feeling my chest.<br><br>I looked at him in daze and as soon as he saw that my eyes were open, he rushed out of the room.<br><br>I froze.<br><br>I couldn't think, I couldn't scream.<br><br>I was in shock.<br><br>I tried to move but I couldn't.<br><br>He came back, I covered myself with the blanket and I was thinking deeply, was it possible?<br><br>Did he really just do that? I had to make sure I wasn't dreaming.<br><br>I got up and I was shaking. I didn't know what to do. I went straight to the other room and cried out of frustration. I was mad, scared, and anxious.<br><br>To let it all out, I messaged a person I trust most, his name is Carry. I vented it all out on him. I was in rage I spitted out curses at him. I was absolutely disgusted with men.<br><br>Sadly, it didn't end there...<br><br>Later that day I tried my best to fall back to sleep and when I woke up, the door was open and he was standing right outside, peaking..<br><br>Again when he saw that I was awake he rushed off inside the other room.<br><br>I was so afraid. I was terrified. I didn't know what else to do and tears just kept falling...<br><br>I got up and went out, checked for other people, and for some reason, there was no other adult in the house.<br><br>There was only, him, my little brother and I.<br><br>I run back inside the room, closed the door, and locked myself up with my little brother.<br><br>Thoughts were coming in...<br><br>"Paano kung saktan ako nito para di ako magsalita? ("What if he hurts me for me not to tell anyone?") What if he does something to my family?<br><br>I was panicking. I couldn't think right. And, this wasn't just the problem. On the very same day, was the deadline for our competition piece; a research paper had to be passed in the local educational department of Pasig.<br><br>I was the group leader.<br><br>We were the school's representative.<br><br>In the middle of the situation, I was crying while messaging the group members on what to do. We prepared for it for months, spent so much, and all because of me it would be put into waste?I couldn't tell them what was happening but I wouldn't be able to bare the thought of just leaving them hanging. I tried to pull myself together and even lied. I told them I was sick.<br><br>So much emotions building up all at once.<br><br>I was grasping for air. I tugged in a pillow, embraced my brother, and prayed.<br><br>I fell asleep and was woken up by the sound of doorknob trying to be opened...<br><br>That was my last straw!<br><br>I messaged Carry to contact my mom, he told her everything, and she went home immediately.<br><br>I even forgot about eating. I was at the peak of my emotions to feel hungry. I was exhausted from crying and panting. Praise God my brother didn't go out of the room, he stayed beside me through it all.<br><br>It was a long and messed up day. I still remember the scene, being in one corner of the bed in a dark room with only light coming from the desktop, crying, looking at my brother, afraid, frustrated, mad, in pain, and thinking "why me?" "why did this happen?"<br><br>-End-</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The next morning everyone in the family knew about it. Our house helper and her son were asked to leave. The reason why we took him over is due to a serious family experience. It could have been the cause of why he could have done such an act. But,<br><br>This incident most certainly affected me.<br><br>I thought I can easily get over with what happened. I convinced myself and the people around me, that I was okay and it'll take a little while for me to recover, but I was wrong.<br><br>It hurt and impacted a little too far than I expected.<br><br>Days passed, I had nights in which I'd dream of him calling my name, I'd hear an audible voice saying, "Eunice" and I'd wake up in the middle of the night crying.<br><br>I was damaged.<br><br>Sembreak's over.<br><br>Resumption of classes, I wasn't ready yet. I had everything clump inside my chest.<br><br>You see, I am the type of person who is always there for people. I was seen as the positive one. The optimist. The motivator. The inspiring. The listener.<br><br>And I,<br><br>Just couldn't accept the fact that something like this happened to me. So, I kept it from everyone. I denied it. I came back, met my Tuesday fellowship group in class and told them, "May pinagdaanan ako nung sembreak pero okay na ko ngayon" (I went through something last sembreak but I'm okay now).<br><br>They willingly opened up their lives and I didn't. I faked a smile here and there and walked around as if I wasn't carrying any burden and problem.<br><br>If you're reading up to this point, I want to tell you, it's okay to not feel okay. Keeping up with your reputation is not going to help at all. Ask for help, talk to someone. "We are not meant to live this life, alone" - Anon.<br><br>Because,<br><br>With all the suppressing of the traumatic experience, I stopped reaching out, became selective, irritated, mad, isolated, distant, to a point of skipping school. I would make up all these excuses just to not attend class.<br><br>I was a student-leader and representative of the school in competitions. There was a regional level research congress, I was a member of the Gender and Development Organization in school and we had to prepare for the activities for the month, and there was an upcoming inter-school competition for Speech Choir, all happening in the same month— November.<br><br>And I was, going through the toughest time of my life.<br><br>I was restless, I kept going from place-to-place. One minute I'm in a meeting, next I'm in practice, sometimes I'm in class, most of the days I was absent. I was out of focus.<br><br>I didn't want to be around people because I didn't want anyone to notice and as much as I can I distracted myself with a lot of things because I wanted to forget.<br><br>I was so worn out. Spiritual aspect nalang yung lumalaban sakin (My spiritual aspect was what's left of me). My sisters were asking me bakit daw di ako pumapasok sabi ko "wala naman gagawin eh" (My sisters were asking me why I wasn't attending class, I always say, "We're not doing anything at all")<br><br>During those days, all I that I can think of was that people are selfish and all they care about was satisfying their needs, desires, and lust; I was blinded, I became so full of hate. Consumed by my thoughts and emotion.<br><br>And because I was always out of school, I ended up passing my responsibilities to others. I also started becoming this toxic person that feed on rewards and applause for things I felt my worth was anchored to. I was posting pictures of myself pretending that I was happy, doing okay, and have my life all together. I wanted to feel valued but none of it filled the void. I was still empty.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">New Year went by and I wanted to start fresh, I deleted my old facebook account thinking that maybe that way I can really forget. That would make me feel new again. Everyone was asking me why and I said, "Wala lang, New Year eh" (Nothing, it's just New Year).<br><br>Still. Nothing changed. I even started getting into a lot of misunderstandings and petty fights with my classmates. I didn't want to do schoolwork. I was complaining all the time. I was saying words that are out of anger. I found myself going back to the person I was before meeting Jesus.<br><br>Classes rolled back in, Christmas break was over.<br><br>The usual, I skipped school. I pretended I was sick.<br>The next thing I know, I was failing in class. Third quarter results came out, I wasn't part of the top students in class, didn't even make it to the top 30. Prior to this, during the second quarter, I failed in Chemistry, one subject that would jeopardized college. I have to make up for it or else my future will be at stake.<br><br>I was at the pit of everything. Ashamed, full of guilt, angry, frustrated, afraid, anxious, uncertain, pressured, and it's been going on for months.</p>

Diligent, attentive, active, and a "follower" of Jesus.<br><br>One night came to a thought of taking my own life...<br><br><strong>Please</strong>,<br><br>If you're reading this right now, God is speaking to you, the hardships we go through is not from Him. Do not look at the circumstances that you're facing, turn away from what the world is trying to make you see, it's not easy, really, I tell you, it's not. It can be dark out there, there are a lot of events in this life that is going to hit us hard and beat us down.<br><br>But let me tell you one truth, we're not fighting alone, STAND BACK UP! It's been far too long since you've been down there. Someone and His Name is Jesus, overcame this world through His Love and HE IS FOR YOU.<br><br>Maybe you're wondering now, what difference does it make if I accept Christ? If you, as a follower still suffered from all of that? Suicidal thoughts? Failure? Hatred? That doesn't sound like the abundant life that He promised.<br><br>Being a follower of Christ involves completely surrendering your life to Him, letting Him live inside of us, trusting Him in this journey, allowing Him to face the battles for our sake because that's how much He cares and loves us. That is the reason why He died on that cross. In this life we go by His strength, His will, His heart, and His might.<br><br>But by the looks of it, I was taking hold of my own.<br><br>My hands were tied to the thought that "I can do this", battling the challenges with my own strength. Keeping everything all to myself. Pride manifested and my ego won over me.<br><br>Right now, I invite you.<br><br>Put your walls down. Open your doors and let Him in, fully.<br><br>-End-</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">One thing is for sure, God never left my side, even when I was going off-trail and doing things by myself He patiently waited for me to let Him fight for me. For the longest time, I didn't put my guard down. I let the enemy rule over me by believing that I didn't need any help.<br><br>But, God didn't give up on me.<br><br>He continued to pursue me. He kept on reminding me of how much He loves me, of how much He wanted to get me out of the situation that was not meant for me.<br><br>He revealed Himself in people.<br><br>The very ones that I isolated myself from. The ones I tried to run away from. Distanced myself from.<br><br>He never stopped and He's not going to stop until He sees you running back towards Him.<br><br>You are His child.<br><br>Do you believe that?<br><br>...<br><br>My mom closely monitored me, she wanted to take me to a psychologist but, I refused when I should have went. I knew I needed one but I was thinking "Kaya ko to" ("I can do it").<br><br>Seek help, there's nothing to be ashamed about it. If you know you need wisdom outside yourself, go please? They are there for a reason. They are there to guide you into releasing what's inside of you.<br><br>My dad called and spoke words of encouragement over me. He knew exactly what to say.<br><br>My sister ate Chee, counselled me and shared her own experience. She was threatened of beind raped by a neighbor when she was around 11 years old. She couldn't step out of the house like me she was traumatized. She gradually got over it as time passed by. She told me I will to.<br><br>My eldest sister, ate Zee, knows how much I love travelling so she took us out on a spontaneous, trip to San Juan, La Union. She took me out of the house as far as possible. I saw how concerned she was that the moment I went near the shore she was right beside me and said, "This is for you, okay?"</p>

                    I was silly enough to think that I was weak if I admit that I was in pain. This was in January, 3 months had passed and this was the only time, I accepted the fact that I needed God to remove this pain that I have been trying to heal myself from. I have been hiding from Him under the shadows of hate, fear, guilt, and shame. I blamed myself for what happened but, after hearing this message, my eyes were opened.</p>

To you who is hurting, suffering from mistreatment, those who are going through pain, I speak healing, forgiveness, and full recovery in your life right now. In Jesus' name. Believe with me.<br><br>Hindi madali, pero kakayanin natin! (It may not be easy, but we can do it). May we choose to be a message of encouragement to people. A light and a vessel. Your life matters regardless of what others have said or done to you.<br><br>Be brave, kind, and live a life that hate has no place. If you are reading until here, thank you. Jesus loves you so much.
