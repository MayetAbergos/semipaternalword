Not one can tell what lies beyond the present of each and every person. We can never be so sure of our tomorrows and less likely be able to predict it. Abraham Lincoln said, "<em>The best way to predict the future is to create it" </em>and that, spoke a volume. This means that whatever we do today can impact our tomorrow.</p>

You will understand more as you read...<br><br>Most SLPs, only found out that the course existed because of others; by others it could be a relative, a friend or a professional related to the field telling us about the profession. Fortunately enough for us, like me, there were people like them who directed us to a path that we never envisioned of taking.<br><br>What once was just a risk taken for a shallow purpose of merely having a course in college paved the way to the sensation of finding a home where hope and love resides. As my freshman year nearly comes to its end, I already have fallen deeply in love with Speech-language Pathology.<br><br>It is ever fulfilling to go through subjects wherein you learned about yourself; how we think of ourselves mattered as much as how we treat other people especially our patients. It's more than just knowledge, memorizing, deadlines and passing. It is being accountable to the lives of those who need your help; seeing them as a reflection of who we are. It's more than just positive thinking; it is giving a person something to believe in; that they are capable, loved and valued despite being in a state wherein all their life they view themselves as different, an outcast and a burden.</p>

It should satisfy your hunger for genuine happiness 'cause when greed and pride comes in, it will automatically blind us in serving people the way they should be served. Service comes hand-in-hand with the word empathy; it is putting ourselves in the shoes of others, it is going outside of our own comfort zones because our patients are people who strongly desire to be better; making them feel that they belong, that they can be accepted. That WE, can improve their quality of life.<br><br>They have placed their trust in us which is why money should come second, in my credence, a future profession must be something that will not only grant assistance for others but also, develop our sense of being humane thus making it a crucial part of our lives. I know it will be difficult, but it will definitely be worth it...</p>

Seeing those children— pure, sweet, innocent, kind children, just thinking about it makes me squeal! Gee, aaah! Hahaha! There's something about those little ones and I can't seem to explain. On the contrary, it would be painful to witness them having a hard time coping with the situation they did not choose to be in.<br><br>"My sister is speech delayed and has been going through sessions since she was 3 years old." — Marcus Bernardo</p>

He is the reason why I took the course." — Eunice Angus<br><br>These statements sound light until you realize that it is what propels a person to do things <strong>passionately.</strong>..<br><br>Not often do we ask the "whys" and "hows" and that is what makes speech-language pathology so special because it seeks to understand what a person does not say. It goes back to the very roots from how the person was raised to the core cause of the anomaly. Its scope spreads from scientific approach to basic observation in our daily lives. Hearing practitioners tell about their stories inspired me to go for it and test my maximum potentials.<br><br>Another thing is that it is a combination of various fields; medicine, psychology, communication etc. We are counselors with high-spirits and warriors who restore lives. We speak words of power to encourage, motivate, and bring life. We are committed to changing the world, one word at a time. Language is a system of symbols used to communicate; communication is essential in life; life is beautiful.<br><br>We may have different reasons on why we took the course, what matters is that we finish it with the right motive pursuing only one ambition and <strong>that</strong>, is to be of service.<br><br>"Hindi mo man masabi na kailangan mo ng tulong, tutulong at tutulong kami."<br><br>What an SLP does is more than fluency, speech production, language, cognition, voice, resonance, feeding and swallowing and auditory rehabilitation. It is demonstrating life and opening doorways of possibilities for a person with disability. Patients aren't just patients. It's like having one big extended family out there.</p>
