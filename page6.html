                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">College is no joke. Application days, preparation days, examination days, results days, you name it⁠— all were extremely nerve-wracking especially when your parents expect so much from you. Ever since I was in grade 10 I've carved in the very core of my heart that I will be taking Speech-Language Pathology (if you want to know what this course is you may read the prior blog) which is offered only in four schools, namely UP-Manila, University of Sto. Tomas, Cebu Doctor's, and De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute (DLSMHSI).<br><br>To cut the long story short, my parents had a different university in mind, they were thinking about sending me to this particular school because it would cost them less. But, hmm I had a feeling that I was somewhere else to be. Among the four schools, I insisted in studying at DLSMHSI located at Dasmarinas, Cavite which is a 3-hour travel time away from home if you commute and about one and half hours by car. You may be thinking why? I'll tell you later as you read.<br><br>Since elementary until senior high school I was from a public school. Nothing bad about it I loved it! I am who I am today because of all the schools I graduated from. But this time around, I had this feeling of wanting to try something new.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you believe that God purposely gives out an instruction and aligns your desires with His because He is going to use you where He places you and He will definitely not leave you hanging?<br><br>Well, I do.<br><br>With all that is said, this decision, was not&nbsp;just&nbsp;mine. It was, the Lord's. During the time that I was deciding where to study, I prayed, and He gave me this Word dated way back July 1, 2018. He said that I will travel to a certain city for a year. Hmm? I'm from Pasig City, Metro Manila. Travelling to a certain city? UP-Manila? No. UST? No. Cebu? I wasn't able to apply here so no? Hahaha! Yup! Which leaves only the last school, DLSMHSI.<br><br>There it was, the answer that I was waiting for. But wait... it gets more exciting...</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Talking about provision, my parents and I had a deal, I, must become a scholar in that institution (if I insist on studying there, because really the tuition fee is insane). You see the amazing thing about having a Word from God is that you trust Him with all your heart. Even if it meant, taking risks. It doesn't feel comfortable but you know He's got your back.<br><br>Oh btw if you noticed, the names "Gab and Jessie" written on the Bible was for an investment God wanted me to start on, but I failed to do so.... (I have a point for stating this, read on...)<br><br>This is for everyone, reading your Bible is not a requirement nor does it make you "holy". What you'll find through the pages of the collection of books, is a person— Jesus. In Him, you find your identity. Through Him, you are made whole and blameless. In His Word, you are given direction as to where you will go and where He is going to take you, BUT, you are always left with choices. God never forces Himself. Your choices will make the difference. Choosing to follow Christ is an everyday decision. This obedience comes after you have embraced and accepted the love He has for you. Jesus knew you were worth the payment of dying on the cross 2000 years ago. That even when you fail, He cheers you on and reminds you that He still has a plan. You may feel lost but He is absolutely going to find you where you are at if you just let Him.<br><br>Reading your Bible, is a way of conversing with Him. My tip start with John, the life of Jesus. The Bible contains so much truths yet solely made out of love. It's like reading God's love letter for you and me.<br><br>To continue the story,<br><br>I went to Cavite, submitted my scholarship form with no guarantee of getting granted yet....and immediately paid the reservation slot for my course.. there was no turning back for me.<br><br>But,<br><br>"I trust You, Lord"<br><br>-End-</p>

Trust me, in the four years of my walk with God not once no, never, did He fail in fulfilling His Word, do not get me wrong this was not because I was so good? or because I was serving Him with my effort, or because I pray everyday? or because I do these things for him. No, it was because my heart, my all is surrendered to the Son, Jesus, it is Jesus Himself who carries you. Out of all the trials in life. He didn't promise a perfect life but He did promise that He will be with you and He is going to take you out from any circumstance, as a victor. What's our response? Praise. We thank Him. We give back all the glory to Him.<br><br>Today, Jesus wants your heart too...<br><br>Are you willing to give it?<br><br>-End-</p>

"Lord this one's on You, use me. Do what You must."<br><br>First day of class o'shoot<br><br>I sat down and,<br><br>Antoinette: Hi! What's your name? Sama ka samin!<br><br>And there it began...<br><br>Time passed by so quickly that I barely remember some of the things in between. Every moment though, surely expanded my thinking and perspective towards things. I felt the stretch in my heart, mind, soul, and spirit. To every person I met, I learned something new.<br><br>The class of SLP 1-2 was indeed, one of the best sections I have ever had.&nbsp; I gained so much from both good and bad experiences. I grew exponentially and love, yes love&nbsp;filled my being. It's not because we were excellent or had all these gifts but because everyone had a listening heart.&nbsp;They are home. They are family. They are golden.<br><br>Each one had their own potential, different but important. This is the place where you can just be yourself and have some laughs, cry, or whatever.<br><br>One of my most favorite memories was during our Arts Appreciation activity we were asked to showcase our talents in class. It's not always about grades y'know.&nbsp;Sometimes we just need to be free, appreciative, and expressive so, Tonet and I made a rap song describing who comprises of SLP 1-2. (The idea came from an amazing friend of mine named Neim, thank you bro.)<br><br>Allow me to introduce my section SLP 1-2,</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">So here it goes,<br><br>We had a class in the first semester called "Code Green" which is a subject about studying the life of St. La Salle. Our professor Ms. Libo-on assigned each group to prepare a "liturgy" it is an activity in which we&nbsp;pray, read the gospel, conduct fun and interactive games as a class etc. It definitely united us and it became a leeway to know each other in a deeper level.<br><br>Before even any group led,<br><br>God gave me a vision —<br><br>Goosebumps<br><br>He showed a picture of the class raising their hands accepting Jesus as their Lord and Savior.<br><br>Goosebumps again<br><br>Yup, I was in awe! This was it! This was really it!<br><br>Oh so that's why Lord?<br><br>It's not for me, it was for them. It's not about me, it's about them.<br><br>It's for all those people who will encounter Christ.<br><br>He had already prepared the path even before then, I just needed to step out in faith and do what He asked of me.<br><br>God can use you too! You may think that you can't, but He can.<br><br>"He qualifies whom He calls" — Pastor Chad M. Mansbridge.<br><br>"He can turn your nothing into something into a blessing" — Pastor Mark E. Strong.<br><br>Do you believe this too? I want to reiterate on this though, it's not us whom people need but Jesus, alone.... we are simply vessels used to bring more people in the Kingdom. To touch lives and make Christ known!<br><br>Because through Him, you can bring heaven down here on earth.<br><br>And so,<br><br>God moved.<br><br>I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed with what was happening.<br><br>The people He surrounded me with were the ones that He knew I needed to be able to fulfill His plans.<br><br>During the whole activity, we praised, we worshiped, my classmates were clueless, but we just followed through what the Spirit was doing and as I let Him speak words of life through me, I felt this heaviness in my heart; people broken, seeking for acceptance, finding meaning and love elsewhere.<br><br>Only the hand of God can touch, mend, heal your broken heart and redeem you from your past. His love is unconditional, pure, true, and exceptional. He loves you!<br><br>You may think that you are not worthy, but that is not true. I tell you, that is not true! Jesus cares for you and He is willing to take in all that pain, burden, and suffering you have been battling all this time! His arms are open just for you! Let Him in. He's knocking.<br><br>"Kung iniisip niyo na hindi kayo mahalaga, hindi yun totoo kase may taong mahal na mahal kayo"<br><br>Tears falling down, hands shaking...&nbsp;<br><br>and,<br><br>"May I ask everyone to bow their heads and close their eyes, if you want to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, raise your hand...I'll count to three, you are raising your hand to God not me. Pray this prayer from your heart, repeat after me, because He said whoever confesses by their mouth that Jesus is their Lord and Savior shall be saved"<br><br>1<br><br>2<br><br>3<br><br>raise of hands....<br><br>It is only the beginning.<br><br>-End-</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">A few months passed,<br><br>On one specific evening, on the way back home to Pasig...<br><br>Marisse and I had a conversation about my friends. I felt down and sad because nothing has changed or so I thought?<br><br>Never let the enemy whisper lies.&nbsp;God works, even when we don't see it.<br><br>Marisse: "Yung mama ko rin dati, nahihirapan siya sa mga kaibigan niya, ayaw nila ng Bible pero 20 years after, nagkita sila ng kaklase niya na believer na ngayon, tapos ang sabi sakanya,<br><br>"Natatandaan ko lahat ng sinabi mo noon, salamat""<br><br>Whether you're believer or not, do not underestimate the seeds you plant today. Seeds can be the words you say or how you treat others. One thing I learned about sharing the Word is that people look at our life before they actually believe in what we say, so let's be careful and accountable in the things we do.<br><br>Our duty is to love God above all else, let His love overflow through us so that we may love the way He does, live a life that is abundant, free, and be able to share the good news, regardless if people accept or not. It is never our duty to change people, only God can do that. Our part is to be a good soil and good sower, let Him take care of the rest because soon, in His time, He will grow those seeds and you'll be surprised on how it will bear&nbsp;much fruit.</p>

No matter how many times you've heard the phrase "blessed to be a blessing" its meaning never becomes void.<br><br>This life is not ours, it's not our own. There's so many things we can do— together. Would you agree if I say that we are one body spearheaded by Christ? Every person has the capability to do things big or small, it still counts. I pray this over you, let's not seek to please others, but rather help one another and make actual changes for the benefit of future generations.<br><br>This so-called "good deeds" are nothing but acts if not done with the purpose of truly reaching out for His Kingdom.<br><br>All the activities were fun, memorable, and worthwhile but, the best part was not the goods we gave nor the activities we prepared, but the prayers that the children received. The ates and kuyas of SLP 1-2 got to share a piece of Jesus to the little ones. Every time they stretch out their hands to pray over every child we encountered, the Spirit moved. Seeing the class intently praying for the kiddos was just one result of the goodness of Christ manifesting in them.<br><br>Because we know that we are loved, it's our turn to release that Love to others.<br><br>The children may not understand fully, but God hears prayers.<br><br>I tell you, it was the most amazing and heartwarming sight of all.<br><br>-End-</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">This year, UP-Manila decided to open an application for laterals or transferees and shiftees.&nbsp;It's not every year, they decide to accept, like what one of my seniors from DLSMSHI, Pam Rogers said, "Nung first year ako sabi nila mag-aaccept sila pero hindi naman sila tumanggap"<br><br>But on this particular year, they did.<br><br>God pressed in my heart to seek for "Timothys" (A term believers use to call those whom they can pass on the leadership, Timothy in the Bible was Paul's disciple. A disciple is a follower or a student)<br><br>Lastly, He opened the doors.<br><br>By His grace, I passed. 8 of us out of all of the applicants.</p>
